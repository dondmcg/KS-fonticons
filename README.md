# TheStreetFontIcons
Font icon repo for TheStreet

To add the font-icon library to a project:
1. Download the new font-icons dir to the CMS-TAGS/grails-app/assets/stylesheets/fonts
2. Download the edited _font-icons.scss to CMS-TAGS/grails-app/assets/stylesheets/styles/modules

As long as your file structure is the same as TST-NG these instructions should work otherwise editing the urls from the _font-icons.scss may be necessary

To edit the fonts: 
1. upload the selection.json file to icomoon.io app
2. add, edit or delete and then click "Generate Font"
3. edit the resulting style.css to match the _font-icons.scss file
4. follow the instructions above to add the font-icon library to a project
4. update the gh-pages branch so that the demo page reflects the changes
